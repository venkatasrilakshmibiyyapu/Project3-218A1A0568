            Bengaluru, India – June 18, 2024
            
            Infosys (NSE, BSE, NYSE: INFY), a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting, today announced the launch of Infosys Aster™ – a set of AI-amplified marketing services, solutions and platforms that deliver engaging brand experiences, enhanced marketing efficiency, and accelerated effectiveness for business growth. It drives AI-led transformation of marketing with integrated, real-time view across customers, brands and channels, enabling companies to increase ROI from marketing. With creative services, experience design, digital commerce, MarTech orchestration, performance marketing and marketing operations, Infosys Aster™ brings agility to the marketing value chain for B2B and B2C brands. With Infosys Aster™, global brands have realized up to 50% increase in repeat buyers, 30% improvement in the cost of marketing operations, and 40% increase in sales.
            
            Deliver Engaging Brand Experiences: Infosys Aster™ delivers lasting connections with its human experience design approach amplified by the power of technology. Utilizing advanced technologies like real-time Unreal Engine 3D, AR/VR/XR, and digital twin CGI modeling, it delivers immersive experiences that foster customer intimacy. By taking advantage of AI-powered customer and marketing data platforms, it enables brands to unlock insights from data while also drawing on the power of ecosystems to deepen omnichannel engagement. For example, as the creative partner for an international racing giant, Infosys Aster™ created a holistic digital ecosystem – with compelling visual experiences that were highly customized for user groups – to boost engagement. Taking advantage of a dynamic content engine along with a simple ticketing system, Infosys Aster™ helped the business turn millions of fans into lifelong customers.

It also boosts efficiencies through marketing shared services by centralizing and automating content and design operations, reducing time and cost to activate campaigns. The suite’s AI capabilities, powered by Infosys Topaz™, help brands improve channel efficiencies by analyzing performance data and adapting strategies in real time. For example, a global health-tech company took advantage of Infosys Aster™ to accelerate their campaign management cycles – from setup to execution for 80+ markets driving savings in cost of operations.
            
            Accelerate Effectiveness for Business Growth: Infosys Aster™ helps businesses create shared digital foundations, by integrating MarTech and enterprise systems, to create new avenues to value for sales and marketing. AI-driven analytics and customer insights help marketers increase customer lifetime value by personalizing outreach, nurturing meaningful conversations, and garnering high-quality leads. This supports brands in driving effective lead-generation campaigns, marked by better cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. Marketers can also capture demand and nurture repeat purchases with the suite’s real-time recommendations based on customer behavior. Predictive insights also help in influencing pricing strategies. For example, a retail chain used AI-amplified insights from Infosys Aster™ to develop their app-based promotional loyalty program that resulted in sales boost for them.
